There are two stacks

Main stacks and side stacks

Syncronazed code alawys moved to main stacks

When main stack gets empty then it cheks on side stack if the  
the answer arrived or not  if its arrived then it will go to ms

Event loop gets information from the ms to ss

// callbacks are those which runs after the completion of async code

// fetch : â€˜ https:/ facebook.com
Sends a request to faceboo server to get some datas

Axios
Fetch
Set timeout
Set interval
Xhml request 
Promises


All these are async codes To run their and we need call backs, then catch , async awaits

Promises ka sath yesa hai ki kuch codes hum likhenge aur future
me agar chalega toh  resolve if promise doesnot complete then reject

When we are trying to write async await then make the nearest function async
And if we write inside it anything the function suppose i write fetch then uske
age await lagao by this we dont have to write then here
